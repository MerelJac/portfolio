# Portfolio

# Desrcription
This page is designed to be a web developer's portfolio for future employers to learn about the developer and view projects. 

# Usage
This web page is designed to display the web developer, featured work, and contact information. The navigation bar at the top of the page will report the user to that section of the web page. If you click on the images/sections under "featured-work," you will be taken to that site to view the project but anchored to the original page. If you click the icons under "contact-me," you will be able to contact the web developer.
